Hey Hamsters! Today we’re looking at Drake’s $1M loss, Jullian Assange’s DAO and Metallica’s meme coin not by Metallica. Let’s go! The official X account of a heavy-metal band Metallica was hacked. Ironically enough, the account promoted the “METAL” meme coin on Solana. Meme coins are the most booming sector of crypto so far in 2024, with real-world tokenization and AI coming second and third, respectively. Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, is on his way to freedom after a plea deal with the US government. AssangeDAO's token rose by 80% since its release, and the DAO is raising funds for legal fees. The index that shows the overall mood on crypto markets now stands at 46, meaning Fear, following recent market fluctuations. Canadian Rapper Drake Loses Over $1 Million In Bitcoin Betting On NBA Finals and Stanley Cup Finals. He bet wrong, and he lost all of it. Well, that's all for today!

x_u4D78P-Ms,CEX vs DEX: Which one is better? | Ebi.xyz explained ⚡️ Hamster Academy,"⚡️Hamster Academy⚡️

Ebi.xyz referral link: https://bit.ly/4ehGFE6

Hey Hamsters! 🐹 Today, we have another special academy where we will be educating YOU about the differences between a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a centralized exchange (CEX). After all, they both exist for the same purpose — helping buyers and sellers trade. But, by design, each looks a little different. To understand the difference, let’s nibble into the definition. CEXs rely on centralized order books and custodial wallets, meaning users must trust the exchange to manage their assets, while also following government regulations. In contrast, DEXs like Ebi.xyz leverage blockchain technology and smart contracts for non-custodial trading, giving users full control of their assets at all times without the need to trust a central authority. Although DEXs can be harder to use, Ebi.xyz offers a user-friendly limit order book model similar to CEXs, making it easier for newcomers to transition. Additionally, as Hamster Kombat is a partner with Ebi.xyz, users benefit from exclusive airdrops and rewards, which can be redeemed and traded for USDT without requiring KYC verification. That’s all for today! Subscribe and remember: Hamsters are power 💪

With millions of players worldwide, we expanded the game, adding new features like mini-games, skins, and more. Thanks to your support, we’ve been noticed by major crypto exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and KuCoin.

Hey Hamsters! 🐹 In today’s mini-academy we look at the opportunity to make money with your crypto — what we know as staking and how you can get started. How you can earn passive income with Binance? Staking lets you lock your crypto assets to support blockchain operations and in return, you earn more cryptocurrency. It’s like depositing money into a high-yield savings account, but with APRs ranging from 5-20%, and in some cases, even higher with special promos that can reach up to 300%! We'll show you step-by-step how to set up your Binance account, go through identity verification, deposit $HMSTR, and choose the right network. Plus, find out how Binance Launchpool lets you access new crypto projects like Hamster Kombat early and earn rewards with Binance Super Earn. Ready to start staking?

PIas6GBSY6E,"Durov’s post-arrest statement, UK approves only 4 crypto firms, Binance bans CZ ⚡️ Hamster News","⚡️Hamster News⚡️

Hey Hamsters! Durov’s first comment since his arrest in France, meme coin generators’ frenzy and CZ’s lifetime ban at Binance — let’s look at the biggest headlines over the past 24 hours in today’s episode of Hamster News. Pavel Durov, Telegram co-founder, addressed what happened to him for the first time since his arrest in France. In a Telegram post, Durov expressed his surprise over the arrest since, according to him, he was visiting the French embassy pretty frequently in Dubai and helped the authorities with their request to assist in neutralizing a terrorist threat. This week, a new meme coin generator called Snek.fun was launched on the Cardano blockchain, and the company claims it welcomed 20,000 users in the first 10 seconds after the launch. The exchange’s current CEO Richard Teng banned CZ, who co-founded and led the exchange, from ever becoming in charge of Binance. The UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that out of 35 companies that applied for a crypto license last year, it approved 4. The reason? “Weak” fraud and anti-money laundering checks.

Hey Hamsters! 🐹 A lot of crypto love from the Trump family, as they tease an important announcement, Wall Street giants holding strong on Bitcoin, and harsher sentences for crimes using AI — all of that and more in today’s Hamster News. As a part of his campaign, Donald Trump shared his promise of creating a Bitcoin Stockpile for the United States. Analysts are not optimistic, but rather concerned about what it actually means. Donald Trump’s son, Eric, said he fell in love with crypto and DeFi, promising a big announcement. The International Monetary Fund is concerned about El Salvador’s “Bitcoin experiment,” demanding more transparency from the country. IMF insists that many of the risks of these policies have not yet materialized. Grayscale shared the launch of two new crypto investment products, bringing their total to 18. Neither BlackRock, MicroStrategy, GrayScale, or Fidelity sold their Bitcoin during the ongoing market crash! If a criminal used AI to plan, commit, or cover up a crime, they would get a stronger sentence, the Department of Justice in the US says in a newly published recommendation. That’s all for today!
