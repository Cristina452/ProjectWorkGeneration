mTSBDoY9hfY,Reggie Bush Was SHOCKED He Wasn‚Äôt Drafted 1st Overall üò≥,"Reggie Bush talks about being caught off guard when he wasn't selected with the number 1 draft pick in the 2006 draft. After an incredible career at USC Bush was thought of as the unanimous 1st pick and had been in continuous dialogue with the Houston Texans who were expected to draft Bush with the 1st pick. Bush recollects finding out on the night of the draft the Texans chose Mario Williams and that he would fall to the New Orleans Saints with the 2nd overall pick and after talking to Drew Brees he was confident in going there. #shorts #football #nfl #draft #nfldraft #neworleanssaints #houstontexans #bush #usc #college #ncaa

you. You must know the help defense, because that is where your main defender is leading you to. If you read the help, then you will know how to attack the person in front of you and what moves you can actually pull off.
This is also why off ball movement during isolations are key. If Tristan Thompson didn't set a decoy flare screen, LeBron James wouldn't have had a shot that easy at the rim. Rather, Ibaka probably would've stayed down and LeBron would ve had settle for a middy or a heavily contested layup.",2024-10-11T18:45:04Z,PT26S,UCok_HjOel5ODVI76l0yHaOA,Discipline or Regret?,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/stAHAlAxSyc/default.jpg,1302410,74228,503,17,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"

4uT5frZwAGg,What Magic Said To Kareem After His FIRST NBA Game üòÇ | @AllTheSmokeProductions #shorts,"Magic Johnson tells a story from his rookie year as a Los Angeles Laker which was also the first game he was playing alongside Kareem Abdul Jabbar.  It was a close game and with the Lakers down by 1 point with 2 seconds to go, the Lakers inbounded the ball to Kareem and he hit a game winning skyhook.  Magic proceeded to do the most Magic thing and celebrated like they just won the championship (was that a precursor of things to come?!) and Kareem gave him a stern talking to about it when they got back to the locker room.  And Magic had the perfect response cooked up for Kareem üòÇ

He says that Gil is lying to everyone and capping that he dropped 60 points on Kobe Bryant in an NBA game. He was just scoring points in the game not actually giving Kobe buckets. They go back and forth but Gil says that if you were in the game and got cooked then you are getting included in the story. Every hooper know how this story goes doesn't matter if you were guarding me or not. Another hilarious moment on the podcast as it enters it's 3rd season heading into the 2025 NBA Season.

Covering sports in a unique way since 2018. 

If you‚Äôre looking for high quality sports content, then this is the channel for you! I‚Äôve covered Baseball (NCAA, LLWS, Professional), Football (NCAA, NFL), Softball (NCAA), Basketball (NBA, NCAA), Hockey (NHL), and much more!

The best part of my work as a YouTuber is being able to provide coverage of sports that may not receive as much attention as they should to the large audience I have built over the years. Many of the sports I cover aren't posted by any other YouTubers, which makes this channel that much more important.

One of my favorite accomplishments is revolutionizing the way sports channels create thumbnails. I've adopted two different styles, one with logos on the left and a game snapshot on the right, and the other with the logos in the middle and game snapshots representing both teams on either side.

I have a combined 4 years of experience as a Baseball & Basketball Play by Play announcer, which is where I learned my skills for commentary/breakdowns.

zbEiLUMZzN0,"Bye Week Baseball, Eagles ‚ÄòConstipated Offense‚Äô and Defending Kickers with Pat McAfee | Ep 105","92%ers, we are back with another episode of New Heights! 

In this episode, we are joined by an incredible guest, Pat McAfee! 

Before we get to Pat we‚Äôve got an update on Travis‚Äô debut as a game show host and when you can expect our review of Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. 

We‚Äôve also got a full recap of the double tailgates Jason attended over the weekend, we try to figure out what was on Travis‚Äô shirt, and what he thought of Game 1 of the ALCS. 

We also get into everything else from Week 6 in the NFL, including Jason‚Äôs full thoughts on everything that happened in the Eagles/Browns game, Davante Adams becoming a Jet, and the Cowboys getting blown out again at home. 

Finally, we sit down for an electric conversation with Pat McAfee. The guys get into everything from his thoughts on Jason‚Äôs kicker slander, how he got started in the media after playing, his way too early Super Bowl pick, and so much more.
