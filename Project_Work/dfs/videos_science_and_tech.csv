1zL7JAoaGUA,3 Phone Tips That Could Save Your Life,"When disaster strikes, staying connected can be a matter of life and death. But what happens if your cell phone loses service in the middle of a natural disaster like a hurricane or wildfire? Many of us rely on our phones for emergency calls, GPS, and keeping in touch with loved ones, but most don‚Äôt realize that a bit of preparation can make all the difference.

First, make sure your phone has the latest software update. Newer devices, like those running iOS 18 or the latest Android models, can access emergency satellite texting, even when regular networks are down. This means you don‚Äôt have to spend on expensive satellite internet to stay in touch.

Next, enable data roaming on your phone. This feature allows you to use other cellular networks when your primary carrier's service is disrupted. In a crisis, this could be your lifeline to critical information. Sometimes this feature is enabled automatically during a natural disaster, but during Hurricane Helene this system failed and the data roaming had to be enabled manually for many people. 

Lastly, know where your local Register of Deeds office is located. Often these offices have stable internet connections when everything else is down, making them a surprising but reliable spot to regain communication.",2024-10-07T11:20:00Z,PT1M,UCUi2SFPyyDNcsH2ZGpHyQIQ,magnify,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1zL7JAoaGUA/default.jpg,3034282,230714,2135,28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology

v7aRWcM0AFE,A New Type of Computer Case | HAVN HS 420 Thermal Benchmarks & Review,"Sponsor: NZXT C1500 Platinum PSU on Amazon https://geni.us/KvKlUi
HAVN is a new brand from the CaseKing group and is making the HAVN HS 420 and HAVN HS 420 VGPU computer case, which is one of the most unique cases we‚Äôve seen in a long time. The case has excellent overall construction quality, innovative ease-of-installation features and fan mounting options, and experiments with new cooling approaches. HAVN is formed by defectors from Fractal, Cooler Master, NZXT, and Sapphire and is backed by big money with the CaseKing group (CaseKing is one of Europe‚Äôs largest hardware retailers). Our review of the HAVN HS 420 tests 8 variations of 6-fan configurations, chosen as a head-to-head with the chart-leading Antec Flux Pro that we recently reviewed. Our benchmarks include thermals, acoustics, and build quality in comparison to some of the best gaming PC cases on the market.

Hi there!

It‚Äôs great to meet you ü•∞

My name is Maneetpaul Singh, but my friends call me Maneet (pronounced muh-neet). I'm a bookworm from Connecticut who loves tech. When I bought my first e-reader in 2020, I began reading more than I ever had before. I‚Äôve made it my mission to help people fall in love with reading through Book Tech.

Think of me like the MKBHD of books.

There are three things I want you to know.

(1) If you'd like to read a new nonfiction book with me every month, join my book club with a community of 1,000+ bookworms: https://go.maneetpaul.com/book-club

(2) If you‚Äôre struggling to build a daily reading habit and want to know how I became a bookworm, check out my short book titled Just One More Chapter: https://geni.us/GQX7rKe

(3) If you just want to chat, email me anytime hello@maneetpaul.com. I personally respond to every email.

Thanks so much for being here.

Happy reading!

Especially when you have to eat the loss. Thankfully because of all you physically attractive people that watch my videos, and the good folks at my local electronics recycling company, Trident Boston,  I was able to give my customer better technology in a better computer than they had before. A refurbished Lenovo ThinkPad P15s that's packed with tech that's 2 years newer and in much better condition than their old HP ZBook pc . And even though I'm still out $600, at least I turned a terrible situation into a good one, which is exactly how I built my businesses reputation.

LINKS MENTIONED IN THE VIDEO FOUND BELOW


Instructions to help us train server-side waldo:

First download the free OHD base game: 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/736590/Operation_Harsh_Doorstop/

Next, find the server browser and join the server named Waldo Data Collection Server

This should prompt you to download a mod from the steam workshop which will enable data collection. Although this mod is downloaded onto your client, it's not actually collecting data from your client, only from the server. Your game client just needs to know about the mod running on the server to avoid a version mismatch.

If for some reason you cannot auto-download from within the game client, the mod can also be manually installed via steam workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3330314879

Once you're in, just play the game normally for as long as you'd like! And play on our server (shown in the video) - 
waldo landing page 






If you are a dev and would like to consider using server-side ML cheat detection, contact us here - https://waldointelligence.com/contact-us/




The monitor I used in the video - https://us.rog.gg/32UCDP




Regarding my faith in Jesus - if you would like to learn more I highly suggest this channel - https://youtu.be/qnWoVk-mbyY?si=lOOu80OQhs9h5qRW

Ordering game consoles from suspicious websites is never a great idea, especially when the box tells you that they accept no legal liability if the copyright owners come knocking, but does Linus think this is worth the black SUVs pulling up to his house?

Check out @TORRASOfficial iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max cases: https://amzn.to/4h3szZ7

I bought the iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Max to see if I could possibly switch back to the smaller 'Pro' after using the 'Pro Max' for the past 3 years. The main reason I thought it'd be possible is because they both have the same features and the fact that 6.9"" seemed too large for my hands.

So in this video, I review the iPhone 16 Pro Max vs the iPhone 16 Pro after 1 month of daily usage, with an eSIM in each phone. We discuss the camera, battery life, performance, design, weight, camera control, and much more. Enjoy!

I'm the Internet Privacy Guy. I'm a public interest technologist. I'm here to educate. You are losing your Internet privacy and Internet security every day if you don't fight for it. Your data is collected with endless permanent data mining. Learn about a TOR router, a VPN , antivirus, spyware, firewalls, IP address, wifi triangulation, data privacy regulation, backups and tech tools, and evading mass surveillance from NSA, CIA, FBI. Learn how to be anonymous on the Internet so you are not profiled. Learn to speak freely with pseudo anonymity. Learn more about the dangers of the inernet and the dangers of social media, dangers of email.


I like alternative communication technology like Amateur Radio and data communications using Analog. I'm a licensed HAM operator.

rDazo8tkCPU,Android 15 is HERE! Plus HUGE Pixel Drop!,"Google just released a ton of new features for Android 15 and a new Pixel Drop! In this video, we'll dive deep into all the most noticeable changes in Android 15 and tell you everything you need to know about new features for your Pixel phone, watch, and tablet.

DISCLAIMER: This video erroneously says some features are part of Android 15 that will actually be a part of a future release. Likewise, some features are said to be for Android 15 but are actually exclusively for Pixels. Android Authority regrets these errors.

These features were not included in the October 2024 Android 15 update but will likely come at a later date:

- Limiting charging 
- Keyboard switcher key 
- Screen recording and casting chip
- Redesigned settings app
- Notification cool down

Additionally,¬† the Home Control Screensaver and the new Widget Button are noted in the Android 15 section, though they are part of the Pixel Drop (the screensaver is for Pixel tablets only). The Volume Panel redesign is also Pixel only.

AGvSpJi5-Y0,How OceanGate Titan Sub Realtime Hull Monitor FAILED! RTM,"As the investigation of the OceanGate Titan submersible implosion continues, Jeff Ostroff gives a thorough analysis of how the Titan sub was equipped with an RTM early warning system designed to protect the human occupants, a patented safety feature known as the Real-Time Monitoring system. 

This system of multiple sensors placed throughout the interior side of the carbon fiber pressurized hull was designed to give a series of feedback from acoustic sensors and strain gages to alert the occupants of the carbon fiber submersible to impending catastrophic damage to the hull.

It was supposed to give them enough warning time to resurface safely before the carbon fiber hull could implode or buckle instantly.

But on the morning of June 18th, 2023, history was made when the Ocean Gate Titan sub imploded leaving the world with questions on how this could have happened, and now that everybody knows how this sub was engineered, we are all wondering how this real-time monitoring system have failed and allowed the implosion of the Titan sub to progress without warning.

In this week‚Äôs episode, we discuss how metering modes can ruin your exposure. Metering modes are one of those lesser spoken about things in photography - it wasn't until a few years into my career that I fully understood what they we're meant for. And, as with most things in photography, there's many different metering modes to choose from, Matrix, Center, Spot, Highlight, depending on what you're photographing. In this video, I'll walk you through a hands on approach that'll help decide which metering mode you should be using for your genre of photography. I hope you enjoy this week's video and as always thanks so much for watching! - Mark D.

fZ_LVPAKaUE,Sony Bravia 7 Mini-LED TV Review | Amazing Picture! But ‚Ä¶,"The Sony Bravia 7 TV, while overshadowed by the flashier Bravia 9, is still a noteworthy option, especially for those seeking an affordable Sony mini-LED TV. We break down the pros and cons in this detailed review. The Bravia 7 is easy to set up, boasts excellent color accuracy, brightness, and motion handling, making it a superb choice for dedicated entertainment spaces. However, its poor off-angle viewing and reflection handling limit its recommendation for average living rooms. Overall, the Bravia 7 is a great TV for home theater enthusiasts but may not suit everyone‚Äôs needs.

EEXI6r08908,Introducing: Bolt & Bolt-M,"Introducing Bolt: a family of man-packable Autonomous Air Vehicles (AAVs) that combines advanced AI with an integrated and operator-friendly design. In its base configuration, Bolt delivers a rapid response capability for real-time situational awareness. 

Bolt-M is a munition variant that arms any ground force with simple, flexible, and lethal precision firepower that every warfighter would choose to carry when every pound matters. 

Today, there‚Äôs a high level of skill and specialization required to manually operate weaponized FPV drones. Bolt-M removes that barrier and automates the thousands of flight inputs required to find, track, and strike targets - freeing operators to focus on four key decisions:  

1. Where to look
2. What to follow
3. How to engage
4. When to strike

J_jv15xgfEc,Testing Thousands of G15 Germanium Diodes,"I can‚Äôt fault them, they‚Äôre nearing 70 years old, and that‚Äôs a big ask from diodes that old! Still, we know for a fact that we have at least two bad diodes, and I suspect we may have dozens more. Which means, it‚Äôs time to test diodes. But when the machine has more than 3,000 diodes lurking inside of it, how do you test that many without losing your mind? Well, turns out, Bendix made a pretty awesome little tester to do just that!

j0yKLumIbaM,ChatGPT-O1 Changes Programming as a Profession. I really hated saying that.,"AI's have not been able to do as well as professional programmers up until now.  For a small subset of entry-level programmer jobs, that's no longer true (at least until the new hire becomes more experienced).

It still doesn't have the judgement a programmer needs (or anything close to it), and it can't do the communication parts of the job (and is still awful at writing tests).  But it's starting to live up to the capabilities of this form of Machine Learning.

If your only programming experience is homework assignments, or If you're programming workflow primarily consists of copying and pasting from Stack Overflow, then I've got some bad news for you.

00:00 ChatGPT-O1 is different
02:00 What I've been testing
03:03 Coding RegExes is Rust
05:19 Incorrect Assumptions and Expectations
06:22 Rechecking ChatGPT-4o. Still bad
06:59 The specific case where it might replace a programmer job
07:11 But, it's a stupid job that shouldn't exist
08:03 Many C.S. programs don't prepare for useful skills
09:24 O1 Still has a lot of limitations
10:48 Just as bad at tests as Claude 3.5
11:16 Still bad at picking between alternatives
11:51 O1 couldn't even make this compile
13:40 ""Human-like reasoning"" claim is nonsense
14:22 Don't panic - tools obsolete skills every few years
15:23 But, things are going to be bumpy
15:35 Advantage to smaller, nimble companies for a while
16:01 Still going to be plenty of programmer jobs
17:35 But you need to learn how to use these tools, and well

üìºVideo Summary:
Technology that used to be only possible in Science Fiction is now slowly turning into reality. 3D printers can make almost anything and the technology gets better every year.  It's a type of Additive Manufacturing.  Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common type of 3d printing.  Filament is the material used to create the 3d objects.  Polylactic Acid or PLA is the easiest filament to get started with but there are many others. Bambu Lab is a company that creates 3d printers - they are on the cutting edge of the technology.  The A1 3d printer is the one shown in the video.  The Toolhead and the Build Plate move around to create your 3D Object.  Several stepper motors are involved to move the pieces of the machine.  The Slicer is what creates the G-Code which is then used by the 3d printer.  The AMS lite can be used if you want to print in multiple colors.  There is a lot of waste that comes because of this process - Purged Filament or ""Printer Poop"".   The A1 is a ""Bed Slinger"" and is an Entry Level 3D Printer.  The X1-Carbon is an improved 3D printer. It's called a ""CoreXY"" because the Toolhead only moves along the X and Y Axis.  This allows for much more stable 3d prints.

CP8f2BE1Pko,"Google once forgot to renew its domain, Google.com, and somebody bought it","It still boggles my mind that Google once forgot to renew its domain, Google.com, and somebody bought it.

This was in 2015. 

Sanmay Ved was browsing Google Domains one night trying to learn its interface.

As a test, he put in Google.com.

He clicked the add to cart button.

He's like, ‚ÄúWhat? This shouldn't work.‚Äù

Curious, he went through the full checkout process.

Then he got the message, ‚ÄúTransaction of $12 posted to your account,‚Äù and many more similar ones.

The dude literally bought and owned Google.com.

He got emails saying he was the owner of it.

He got to see all the secret sites that Google.com owned.

He was freaking out.

The market cap of Google at the time was $447 billion and he just bought its domain for $12.

And you can guess what happened next.

He gets this message saying the order was cancelled.

‚ÄúGoogle has reverted the purchase,‚Äù acknowledged it, refunded him of course, and were nice enough to offer him a reward.

That reward was kept secret for a good minute.

Until The Verge revealed it: Google gave a reward of $6,006.13.

And if you squint real hard, this spells out Google.
